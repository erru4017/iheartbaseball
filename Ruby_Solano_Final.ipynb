    "## Pitching ###\n",
    "In Assignment 2, you evaluated 5 Rockies pitchers by comparing pitch selection and movement of their pitches at home and away. In this next assignment, you will also evaluate pitchers in different environments or at different times. The specifics of how you do that are up to you. Your assignment needs to fulfill the following high-level objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Pitchers to compare ###\n",
    "(10 pts) You need pitchers that you will compare. Examples include groups of pitchers compared to other groups, an individual pitcher compared to another individual, or one pitcher compared to himself at different times in his career. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Reason for your comparison ###\n",
    "(10 pts) You need to have a reason for why you think the comparison is meaningful. For example, you might compare the star pitcher from a hitters park to the star pitcher at a pitchers park. This comparison could be meaningful to evaluate the effect of the run-scoring environment on their approach to pitching. A comparison that wouldn't be meaningful is average pitcher A compared to average pitcher B, both on average teams. That's not a result that anyone would care about. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Basis for comparison ###\n",
    "(30 pts) You need to describe how the pitchers will be compared and then implement your comparison. Examples of comparison include pitch movement and selection, BABIP, BABIP on specific pitches, OBP in different environments. Choose at least three criteria for pitcher comparison. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Data for comparison ###\n",
    "(10 pts) Focus on starting pitchers only because you will have more data. Use 3-5 years of data for each pitcher or time period. A pitcher will need to have at least 3 years of data to be used in this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Analysis ###\n",
    "(20 pts) Your comparison needs to include a basic statistical analysis, such as t-tests, z-tests, and/or confidence intervals. You also need at least one visual presentation of your data, such as a histogram, bar chart, or line graph. Your visual should be appropriate for the type of data being displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Presentation ###\n",
    "(20 pts) You need a 2-page writeup explaining what you did and your results. Your presentation should have clearly marked sections for \n",
    "\n",
    "* Introduction\n",
    "* Problem Definition\n",
    "* Data\n",
    "* Results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other notes ###\n",
    "* Proofread your writeup for typos and proper grammar. \n",
    "* If you compare pitch movement, use the statcast fields for vx0, vz0, ax, az, plate_x, plate_z variables instead of pfx_x, pfx_z, I'm not sure what those do.\n",
    "* Include all code and the writeup together in one notebook."

    "I wonder if you could consider whether the previous play increased win expectancy as a way to weight the WE on the next play. You would use (WE_Current/WE_previous) to give you a value around 1. Greater than 1 means they improved and <1 means they decreased. Use that to weight the next WE calculation. I have no idea what that would do, but it could be interesting. It might be noisy and you might want to consider WE over the previous 2 plays instead of 1, or previous 3 plays."

    "# Data #\n",
    "For each of these 5 pitchers, I calculated their FIP, and BABIP. I then compared those values, as well as their ERA to when they played on the Rockies to when they played on another team. I define good pitchers as having a FIP of 3.5 or below (from https://library.fangraphs.com/pitching/fip/), a BABIP of 0.3 or below (from http://m.mlb.com/glossary/advanced-stats/babip) and an ERA below 4.0 (from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average). I predict that pitchers stats get better once they leave the Rockies because Coors field is hard to pitch at compared to most other parks. Better stats means decreasing the value.  \n",
    "**Matt Belisle**: All of his stats decreased from when he pitched on the Cincinnati Reds to his time on the Rockies. He got traded to the Rockies after he played for the Reds.   \n",
    "**Jhoulys Chacin**: All of his stats decreased when he got traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks after he played for the Rockies.   \n",
    "**Jeff Francis**: His FIP increased from 4.535 to 5.858 after he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds from the Rockies. His other two stats decreased.   \n",
    "**Jordan Lyles**: All of his stats decreased after he got traded to the Rockies from the Houston Astros.  \n",
    "**Drew Pomeranz**: All of Drew's stats decreased significantly after he got traded from the Rockies to the Oakland Athletics.  \n",
    "These results show that the team that a player is on does not really affect how good a pitcher is. There are both examples of being traded to and from the Rockies. Time seems to be the biggest factor, each pitcher got better the longer he played.  \n",
    "The 3 pitchers I will examine further are:  \n",
    "**Jeff Francis** - he was the only pitcher who had a stat get worse. He left the Rockies to go to the Cincinnati Reds. The park factor for Cincinnati is very similar to Coors field, at 1.13.  \n",
    "**Jordan Lyles** - he got traded to the Rockies from the Houston Astros. Houston is a neutral park, with a park factor for runs per game of 0.98.  \n",
    "**Drew Pomeranz** - he got traded from the Rockies to the Oakland Athletics. Oakland is a pitcher's park, with a park factor of 0.84.  "

I plotted a histogram of these results for each pitcher. The histogram has each pitch type and the percentage he pitched that type over the years. After that, I obtained 95% confidence intervals for the difference in pitch type percentages of his most used pitch type. If zero exists in the confidence interval, there is no statistical difference between the two percentages and I can conclude that he did not change his pitching approach after switching teams. "

    "His most used pitch both when he played for the Rockies and when he played for Cincinnati was the *sinker*. The 95% CI for the difference in proportion is [$-0.0588,0.0576$]. Since 0 is contained within this CI, there is no significant evidence that he changed his pitching approach when he was traded from the Rockies to the Reds. "

It should be expected that he changed up his style of pitching after the trade. He went from a hitters park to a pitchers park. \n",

    "# Conclusion #\n",
    "Do pitchers change their approach to pitching after they are traded to a new team? I conclude that they do not. One pitcher, Drew Pomeranz appeared to change his approach to pitching after his trade. This was an extreme case, going from Coors field that has a park factor of 1.26 to Oakland that has a park factor of 0.84. There are 26% more runs scored at Coors field than average, and there at 16% less runs scored at Oakland than average. As I concluded in Assignment 2, park factors do not affect how a pitcher pitches a ball. Pitchers get better the longer they play the game. Another factor besides time that could result in change in pitching style is the coaching staff. Each team has a different style of coaching and could alter a pitchers style.  They continue to work on certain types of pitches and that is what they become good/comfortable with pitching. "
